      <p>When visiting Victoria, BC many folks might assume that this majestic Canadian city -- steeped in British tradition -- is limited in its cultural experiences. However, I have found quite a variety of offerings. Whether you are a foodie or an explorer of unique quaint shops, you will find many opportunities to experience new tastes and treasures.</p>
      <p>On a recent visit, I was suprised to see Caribean, East Indian, Italian, and French restaurants all within the same block. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to visit them all. However, we did visit the Italian restaurant, Fiamo Italian Kitchen, which offers many fantastic choices. Some of the more notable choices are homemade meatballs, gluten-free pizza and pasta, and fresh rooftop salads! The rooftop salad was fantastic and is literally grown on a rooftop two blocks from the restaurant!</p>
      <p>If you haven't visited Victoria in awhile, I highly recommend making reservations soon! For visitors from the United States <abbr>(US)</abbr>, there are many options to access this great city. Whether you arrive via car ferry, seaplane, or Victoria Clipper, your trip will be an adventure! You might even see an Orca Whale Pod or dolphin along the way!</p>
      <p>When I think of the ocean and the peacefulness that it exudes, I recall the Robert Wyland quote,<i><q>The ocean stirs the heart, inspires the imagination and brings eternal joy to the soul.</q></i></p>
